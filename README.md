# JavaScript 'this' Keyword Binding Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue with the `this` keyword in JavaScript.  The problem arises from the implicit binding of `this` in non-method functions.  This often leads to unexpected behavior and is a frequent source of errors for developers. The solution shows how to explicitly bind `this` using `bind`, `call`, or `apply`. 

## Bug Description

The provided JavaScript code demonstrates a function `myFunc` where the `this` keyword is not explicitly bound.  When called directly, the value of `this` depends on the execution context. This varies between environments, for instance, in browsers, it usually points to the global `window` object (or `undefined` in strict mode). This might lead to issues if the function depends on `this` having a specific value. 

## Solution

The bug is solved by explicitly binding `this` to a specific object using `bind`.   This ensures that `this` consistently refers to the intended object when `myFunc` is invoked.
